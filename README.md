Built With

- HTML5 - Semantic Structure
- CSS3 - Custom Styling and Layout
- Flexbox - Primary layout tool for alignment and distribution

Key Features & Learning Objections: 

- Layout Design: Implemented a complex webpage structure with a header, hero section, informational tiles, testimonial, and footer.

- Flexbox Mastery: Used flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items to create a responsive-feeling layout without using CSS grid.

- Component Reusability: Styled repeatable elements like buttons and "info cards" to Keep the code DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).

- Typography & color: Applied specific font weights and color palettes to match a design spec.

What  I Learned: 

1. The Box Model: Managing margins and padding to create white space.

2. Deep Nesting: Organizing Flex containers inside other flex containers to achieve specific alignments.

3. Web Standards: Writing clean, readable HTML that follows accessibility best practices.
